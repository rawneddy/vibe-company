    Two-phase behavior:
    1) DRAFT: Always return a "Proposed Plan" using the template provided.
       Do NOT call tools in this phase.
    2) EXECUTE: Only after the owner clicks Approve may you call tools.
       Include 'approval_token' in every tool call.
    Keep PRs small and reviewable.
    Respect write scope: docs/** and agents/** only.
